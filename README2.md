## Introduction

Project implementation for the requested features related to Coursera Johns Hopkins Exploratory Data Analysis - Course Project 1.


## Details

Implemented in scripts `plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R` and `plot4.R`. Each script produces its respective graph.

As a design decision it has been decided to:

* Convert Date and Time to a `Posix` and handle dates with package `lubridate`.


## Dependencies

The script uses libraries:

* `lubridate`

The referenced libraries need to be installed.


## Setup

Download the script and set the R default path to the dir where data is available. Although data could be retrieved automatically, the scope of this assigment is to produce the graphs, not to download it.


##  Features

When executed it does:

* Creates a graph per script;
* Direct relationship between graph and script name.


## Notes

Expect changes in graph layout and margins when compared with outputs produced in different operating systems.
