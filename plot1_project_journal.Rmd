## Background Info
Original data set from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository][UCIrepo]

### Description of 9 variables
From [UCI web site][UCIweb]

1. Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
2. Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
3. Global\_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
4. Global\_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
5. Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
6. Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
7. Sub\_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
8. Sub\_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
9. Sub\_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

### Loading the data (guidelines)
When loading the dataset into R, please consider the following:

- The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. First calculate a rough estimate of how much memory the dataset will require in memory before reading into R. Make sure your computer has enough memory (most modern computers should be fine).
- We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. One alternative is to read the data from just those dates rather than reading in the entire dataset and subsetting to those dates.
- You may find it useful to convert the Date and Time variables to Date/Time classes in R using the 𝚜𝚝𝚛𝚙𝚝𝚒𝚖𝚎()  and 𝚊𝚜.𝙳𝚊𝚝𝚎() functions.
- Note that in this dataset missing values are coded as ?.

## Getting Data
First download the data (see 'get_file.R' script).
Then, read in data (initially tried `read.csv()` but it read in the data as a single variable. The data is separated by ';' (seen using *text editor*). `read.table()` is slow so `fread()` from 'data.table' package it is (supposedly faster than 'read_table()` from 'readr' package.

***I didn't read the guidelines (previous heading) beforehand as I should have.* I'm adjusting accordingly.*** Plenty of space for the whole data set (__est: `r 2075259 * 9 * 8 / 2^20` Mb__). Load it all and convert.

**NOTE**: _WARNING_ from `fread` because of presence of "?" at row 6840 (columns 3:8). So, these columns were converted to "character" vectors.

``` {r get_data, warning = FALSE}
house_power <- fread("./data/household_power_consumption.txt", sep = ";")

# actual size of house_power
print(object.size(house_power), units = "Mb")

# subset by Date (between 01-02-2007:02-02-2007)
house_power <- filter(house_power, Date == "1/2/2007" | Date == "2/2/2007")

# convert columns to appropriate formats
house_power$Date <- dmy(house_power$Date)
house_power$Time <- hms(house_power$Time)

for (i in 3:9) {
    class(house_power[, i]) <- "numeric"
}
```

## Making Plots (_GUIDELINES_)
Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Your task is to reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.

First you will need to fork and clone the following GitHub repository: <https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1>

For each plot you should:

1. Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels. _**this is the default**_
2. Name each of the plot files as 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚙𝚗𝚐, 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟸.𝚙𝚗𝚐, etc.
3. Create a separate R code file (𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚁, 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟸.𝚁, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚁 constructs the 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚙𝚗𝚐 plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.
4. Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository (no need for separate sub-folders)
5. When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to GitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to date. There should be four PNG files and four R code files, a total of eight files in the top-level folder of the repo.

## Making the plots
I just wrote out what I needed on paper and then wrote out the scripts. Once I got the data in, the plots were easy.

## Things I tried but eventually gave up on or updated
``` {r get_data_extra1, eval = FALSE}
house_power <- fread("./data/household_power_consumption.txt", 
                     sep = ";", check.names = TRUE)
    # warning because of presence of "?" at row 6840 (columns 3:8)
    # these columns converted to "character"
```

To convert "?" to NA (approach from [David Arenburg][DA])
``` {r get_data_extra2, eval = FALSE}
house_power[] <- lapply(house_power, function(x) `is.na<-` (x, x == "?"))
```

``` {r date_time_tests, eval = FALSE}
# original code replaced with mutate
house_power$Date <- dmy(house_power$Date)
    # this also works: as.Date(house_power$Date, format = "%d/%m/%Y")
house_power$Time <- hms(house_power$Time)

# to look at output
time_test <- format(house_power$Time, format = "%H:%M:%S")
```
