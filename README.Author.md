Some comments about my assignment work.
1. I did NOT optimize the read process using subset.  I was spending way too much time on the other items.  Also, I felt that using additional packages (e.g., sql or dplyr) before they were covered in the course materials was incorrect and woudl NOT be as easily reproducable by the evaluator if they didn't have/could'nt install those packages.

Lastly, I could not get the vertical lines in the legend of Plots 3 and Plot4.3.   Again, I spent way too much time trying to get this and though, this really can't be what this course shoudl be about.
